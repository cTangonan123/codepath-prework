## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### List of Favorite Applications and their Features
1. Instagram
    - infinite scroll
    - complex components allowing multiple interactions per post
    - messaging
2. Youtube
    - playlist creation
    - closed caption
    - chromecasting capabilities
3. Reminders
    - set timers for reminder
    - generating subtasks
    - inclusion of metadata
    
### App idea
I've been interested in the social media platforms and their ability to implement infinite scrolling in their applications. For one it generates a positive feedback loop for the user, I'm also intrigued on how it could potentially offset data costs for their servers.
I'm also interested in the creation of playlists as its one means of personalizing a user's account. With the ability to share and post, adds a social element to it, much like Youtube for videos and Spotify for Music.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
